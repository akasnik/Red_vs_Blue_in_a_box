# Red_vs_Blue_in_a_box
FTA hackathon March 2022 (done by Rudnei, Andre, Ricardo, Simona, Andrew and Andrej)

## Intro

In the Cybersecurity area, it is very common Security professionals refer to “Red Team” and “Blue Team”, when they want to specify in each side that Team are playing. Red means “attack” and Blue means “defense”.

Red team plays in the offensive side, and they will work to try compromising their own environment with different cybersecurity tools like many available through a Kali Linux distribution.

Blue team works on the defense against Red team and they are supposed to test the effectiveness of their security solutions.

This is a great scenario for a Microsoft hackathon exercise.

As a Red team will have a Kali Linux VM as the main tool to attack. As a Blue team will have some Azure security services to protect a simple environment that contains a Web App solution and two VMs, one with Windows 10 and one with Windows Server 2019. Those are the Security service that Blue team may work with:

-	Azure Firewall
-	DDOS protection
-	Web Application Firewall
-	Log Analytics (log repository)
-	Sentinel (SIEM / SOAR)

The diagrams below explain how we prepared the solution for the Red vs Blue scenario.
